Hello and welcome to my blog. My name is Shiianov Vadim and on the internet I often go by the name binpord. I'm a [MIPT](https://mipt.ru/english/) and [YSDA](https://yandexdataschool.com/) student and a machine learning engineer. If you want to know more about me, check out the [about page of this blog](https://binpord.github.io/about.html).

In this blog I plan to write articles about working as a software developer and probably some other things I find fascinating. Please feel free to check out my posts, I really hope you'd like them.

This blog has been written entirely using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). If you want to make such a blog of your own, make sure to check out an awesome [Jeremy Howard's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Howard_(entrepreneur)) article and a [GitHub pages template](https://github.com/fastai/fast_template). Don't worry, it is entirely free and mostly effortless. I would really like to personally thank Jeremy and other guys from [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) for their great work on this template.
