Hello and welcome to my blog. Its been written entirely using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). If you want to make such a blog of your own, make sure to check out an awesome [Jeremy Howard's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Howard_(entrepreneur)) article and a [GitHub pages template](https://github.com/fastai/fast_template). Don't worry, it is entirely free and mostly effortless. I would really like to personally thank Jeremy and other guys from [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) for their great work on this template.
